Description: The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often begins with
    correlation based analyses. However, this approach lacks statistical validity
    when applied to relative data including those biological data produced by
    microarray assays or high-throughput RNA-sequencing. As an alternative, Lovell
    et al propose a proportionality metric, phi, derived from compositional data
    analysis, a branch of math dealing specifically with relative data. In a
    subsequent publication, Erb and Nicodemus expounded these efforts by elaborating
    on another proportionality metric, rho. This package introduces a programmatic
    framework for the calculation of differential gene co-expression using the
    compositional data methods introduced in the cited publications.

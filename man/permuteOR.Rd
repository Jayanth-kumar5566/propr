\title{Permute Odds Ratio}
\usage{
permuteOR(A, G, p = 500, fixseed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A, G}{An adjacency matrix.}

\item{p}{An integer. The number of overlaps to permute.}

\item{fixseed}{A logical. If \code{TRUE}, the seed is fixed
for reproducibility.}
}
\description{
This function permutes \code{p} odds ratios for the
 edge overlap between two non-random graphs.
 It does this by randomly shuffling the rows and
 columns of \code{A} (jointly, thus preserving
 the degree distribution).
}
\details{
Note that this function calculates overlap for the
 lower-left triangle of the input matrices.
